<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Envtools</strong> is a command line helper for software developers.</p>

<p>Its primary goal is to simplify the tedious task of initializing a laptop/desktop for a developer. Many tools need to be
  installed, proxy and shell environments need to be configured. One mistake and hours are wasted trying to figure out what
  is wrong when a simple automation could have saved everybody's time.</p>

<p>Not only
  <strong>Envtools</strong> will setup a developer's environment in no time, it also comes loaded with goodies (bash aliases, git
  prompt and completion,
  <span class="mac-only"> fixes for the OS, nvm installer, </span>Atom and VS Code plugins, etc.) as well as unique commands like a simple web server,
  a file encryptor, etc.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<pre>npm install -g envtools</pre> You may need to use elevated user rights (sudo) to run this command.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<pre>envtools [command] &lt;options&gt;</pre> See the
<a href="/?commands">commands tab</a> for detailed information.
